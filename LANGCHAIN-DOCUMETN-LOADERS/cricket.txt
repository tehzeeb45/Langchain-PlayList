Beneath the sun, on fields so wide,
With willow and leather side by side,
The bowler runs, the crowd takes cheer,
A moment of silence—then echoes appear.

The bat meets ball, it soars through sky,
Fielders chase as shadows fly,
The stumps stand tall, the bails take flight,
Cricket’s spirit shines so bright.

From gully streets to stadium’s roar,
It binds us all, from shore to shore,
A game of patience, skill, and grace,
Where every heart can find its place.
